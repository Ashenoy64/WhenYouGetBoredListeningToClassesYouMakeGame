# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe - a simple terminal-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game!

## How to Play

1. Run the executable file:

   ```bash
   ./TicTacToe
   ```

2. The game board is a 3x3 grid represented by numbers from 1 to 9:

   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```

3. Players take turns to place their markers ('X' or 'O') on the board by choosing a number.

4. The objective is to get three of your markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent.

5. The game ends when either one player wins or the board is full with no winner.

6. To exit the game at any time, press `Ctrl + C`.

## How to Build (Optional)

If you want to compile the source code yourself, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using `g++`.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o TicTacToe
   ```
